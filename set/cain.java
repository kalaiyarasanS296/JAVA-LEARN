remove() - removes the specified element from the set
removeAll() - removes all the elements from the set that is present in another specified set
retainAll() - retains all the elements in the set that are also present in another specified set
clear() - removes all the elements from the set
size() - returns the length (number of elements) of the set
toArray() - returns an array containing all the elements of the set
contains() - returns true if the set contains the specified element
containsAll() - returns true if the set contains all the elements of the specified collection
